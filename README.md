"You have to lock in" -Kim Chaewon

As wisely said by Kim Chaewon of LE SSERAFIM, you have to lock in. Thus, I created this website, where, once begun, forces you to leave your computer alone, and touch grass
outside of a computer screen. Call me a god, call me a genius, shower me with praise. The chronic addiction syndrome and the challenge of getting on the leaderboard (local) will
keep you LOCKED IN forever.

haha.
